## Reverse Proxy Configuration

###  Go to the file: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

Update the existing `location` block to:

```nginx
 location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
```
### NOW YOU CAN ACCESS THE APPLICATION IN THE PORT 80 BY NGINX AS A REVERSE-PROXY
